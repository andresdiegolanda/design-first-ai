# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`docs/copilot-context-model.md`** — Reference document explaining how Copilot + Claude
  manage context in agent mode. Corrects the common misconception that context is managed
  via `#file:` tags and context window state. The agent reads workspace files from disk on
  demand — IDE restarts lose nothing, new conversations lose nothing, only unwritten
  conversation history is volatile. Documents a concrete document-driven workflow: app
  description → implementation guide → execution report. Each document is both a
  human-readable artifact and the input to the next step. Includes a mapping to
  Design-First framework concepts.

- **`README.md`** — Repository structure diagram updated to include `copilot-context-model.md`.

## v1.2.1 — 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **`context/skill-business-story-narration.md`** — Three issues corrected in the example:
  1. All four output sections now labeled to match the Output Format spec.
  2. "Out of scope" declaration moved out of the acceptance criteria bullet list.
  3. Technical notes section shown in the example with a generic implementation reference.
  4. Company-specific references in Technical notes replaced with generic equivalents.
  5. Two new Design Constraints added covering issues 2 and 3.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`context/skill-business-story-narration.md`** — New cross-cutting Layer 3 skill.
  Produces two layers from technical context: a business description in plain language
  (no component names, no implementation details, readable by a product owner) and
  acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format (technical precision allowed).
  Stack-agnostic — load with `#file:context/skill-business-story-narration.md` alongside
  any Layer 5 story context. Includes before/after example.

- **`examples/01-spring-mvc/`** — Replaced `examples/01-rag-endpoint/`. New first example
  is a plain Spring MVC in-memory product catalog CRUD API. No database, no AI, no Docker,
  no API key — runs with `mvn spring-boot:run` on Java 21 + Maven.

  Contents:
  - **`app/`** — Spring Boot 3.4.3 | Java 21 | spring-boot-starter-web only.
    `ProductController`, `ProductService` (ConcurrentHashMap), `Product` /
    `CreateProductRequest` records, `ProductNotFoundException`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`.
    17 tests: 8 plain JUnit service tests, 9 `@WebMvcTest` controller tests.
  - **`app/context/`** — Layer 0 (architecture, design principles), Layer 1, Layer 3
    (error handling, testing, in-memory store), Layer 4 (four prompt templates),
    Layer 5 (story context for DEMO-001).
  - **`app/.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — Layers 1+2 auto-loaded for this app.
  - **`conversation/design-conversation.md`** — Full Level 1–5 exchange. Two corrections:
    `ProductRepository` interface removed at Level 2; `Long` IDs replaced with `UUID` at
    Level 4.
  - **`outcome.md`** — What was built, what was caught, what the Layer 0 constraints added.

### Changed

- **`examples/01-rag-endpoint/` removed** — replaced by `examples/01-spring-mvc/`.
  The RAG endpoint example required Docker and an OpenAI API key. The Spring MVC example
  has no external dependencies.

- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** (root) — Load hint added at the top:
  `framework-layer-3-skills.md`, `framework-layer-4-templates.md`, and
  `skill-business-story-narration.md` for story writing. Anti-patterns updated to flag
  `01-rag-endpoint/` as a stale reference. File naming conventions table updated to
  include the `skill-name.md` pattern.

- **`README.md`** — Quick Start updated to reference `examples/01-spring-mvc/`. Structure
  diagram updated. "The Example Apps" section updated. Narration skill added to `context/`
  block in diagram.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-03-18

### Added

**`examples/02-angular-component/`** — Second worked example. Angular 17 standalone
component with debounced search, explicit state management, and 8 unit tests.
No Docker, no API key — runs with `npm install && ng serve`.

Contents:
- **`app/`** — Buildable Angular 17 app: `UserSearchComponent`, `UserService`, `User` model,
  8 Jasmine tests. Standalone components throughout, no NgModule.
- **`app/context/`** — Layer 0 (architecture, design principles), Layer 1, Layer 3 (four
  skills: subscriptions, debounced search, explicit state, Angular testing), Layer 4 (four
  prompt templates), Layer 5 (story context for DEMO-002).
- **`app/.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — Layers 1+2 auto-loaded for this app.
- **`conversation/design-conversation.md`** — Full Level 1–5 exchange. Two corrections:
  `SearchResultsComponent` removed at Level 2; async pipe / Observable state properties
  rejected at Level 4.
- **`outcome.md`** — What was built, what was caught, what the Layer 0 constraints added.

**`levels/master-prompt.md`** — Filled example added below the blank template.

**`README.md`** — "Using Claude Code" added as a sixth Quick Start path.

**Deletability principle** — added throughout the framework.

- **`README.md`** — New "Design for Deletion" section.
- **`context/README.md`** — Design Constraints section connected to deletability.
- **`levels/README.md`** — New "The Conversation Record as Reconstruction Manual" section.
- **`guides/adoption.md`** — New "The Long Game — Deletability" section.

**Superpowers compatibility** — additive changes for Claude Code users.

- **`levels/level-4-spec-template.md`** — New file. Spec document output of Level 4 approval.
- **`levels/README.md`** — Superpowers reference paragraph.
- **`context/layer-0-generation-prompt.md`** — Note on priming Superpowers agents.

### Changed

- **`levels/level-5-implementation.md`** — Two-pass review: Pass 1 (Spec Compliance),
  Pass 2 (Code Quality).
- **`README.md`** — Quick Start updated; diagram updated.
- **`guides/tool-setup.md`** renamed to **`guides/copilot-setup.md`**.
- **`demo-app/`** removed — apps now live in `examples/NN-name/app/`.
- Scoped tooling to VS Code + GitHub Copilot throughout.

### Fixed

- **`README.md`** — `reduce-fiction-ai` corrected to `reduce-friction-ai`.
